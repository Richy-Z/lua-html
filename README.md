# `lua-html`

`lua-html` is a currently unfinished (and likely abandoned) project of mine which aimed to tokenise, and later parse, HTML files.

The main reason this was made was so that components in HTML input could be replaced when using the Sklair CLI tool which is used internally for Numelon websites. Unfortunately, since most projects have been slowly transitioned from Lua to Go at Numelon (at a very grand scale), Sklair has also switched and therefore this library is no longer required, nor does it make much sense for me to continue developing it.

With that being said, if you do actually require HTML tokenisation (and later parsing), there is a very strong foundation here.
