# The `old` directory?

> What is this directory?

This entire repository used to be for a HTML templating engine which (in theory) should have tokenised HTML code, parsed it, then replaced all components with the contents of a component HTML file. Ever since this repository has been generalised into a regular lua HTML tokenisation library (as opposed to a full CLI tool), I have moved any Lua scripts pertaining to this process into the `old` directory.
